I have no idea how to use this app, but I'll post it like this. If you think I am supposed to to this in some other way, say so. If you expect me to know how to use this post a forum thread about how am I supposed to use this.
About the problem. Whenever I use the flight master in Ironforge to fly anywhere, all of my chat windows get removed except for the general, now I should mention that I seperate my combat log and I also make another chat window which I drag above the general chat window and so I have to redo my chat settings every time I use the Ironforge flight master. I hope you can fix this.
